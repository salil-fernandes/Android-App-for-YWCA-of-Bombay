# YWCA
This app was developed to be a kind of event booking type of app that would keep members and non-members up to date on different events that were being organised by the YWCA of Mumbai. The app has also been deployed on Google's Play Store.

The app has dynamic lists integrated with a recycler view to display different events that YWCA has to offer. A one time pop-up message has also been developed such that it appears only when the app is installed and opened the first time on a device. The message informs new comers that they should visit their nearest YWCA branch if they are interested in becoming a mmember.

Logging into the app makes use of a simple OTP mechanism. On logging into the app, by default the Events page will load up listing all upcoming events that the organization has planned. In case a user is a non-member and opens the page of a member-only event, a button is presented near the event poster giving the user an option to become a member. The hamburger style navigation menu has links to an About Us page, Initiatives, Success Stories, a Contact Us page as well as a Logout option.
